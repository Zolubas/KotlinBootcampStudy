# KotlinBootcampStudy
This repository contains the main parts of the kotlin bootcamp provided by Android

## Class 1

[Web developer enviroment](https://developer.android.com/training/kotlinplayground) is an interactive code editor on the web where you can practice writing Kotlin programs.
All Kotlin programs need to have a main() function: fun main() {}
Use the println() function to print a line of text.
Place text you want to print between double quotes. For example "Hello".
Repeat the println() instruction to print multiple lines of text.
Errors are marked red in the program. There is an error message in the output pane to help you figure out where the error is and what might be causing it.
